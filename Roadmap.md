Make it possible to zoom timeline.
-----------
[Popcorn webmaker](https://popcorn.webmaker.org/) does this well, but it is not geared towards touch screens.

Add table of contents with links to all the questions
---------------------
This could be helpful during the interview if it is one where the questions can be asked in any order.

This could be helpful on the timeline since it is difficult to determine which marker corresponds to which question. Clicking question names to seek might be easier.

Structured input. (i.e. form elements)
----------------
It may be useful to always record these at survey start:

 * researcher info
 * setting info
 * subject info
 
It could also be useful to include this data in the previous interview list.

We might also want to use structured input for branching at later points of the interview. This might introduce too much complexity at the design phase.

Simplify interview design process:
------------------------
XLSForms could make it easier to design simple interviews.

Webpages might be the best for designing interview with structured input. The data in `<form>` submissions could be attached to the page's log item, or maybe the Session model.

Add annotation types:
-----------------
One challenge is to determine the right amount of annotation during the interview such that it does not become a distraction, but still does a lot to reduce the amount of review required afterwards.

The minimally distracting annotation is to record the page a question is on. With any interview guide, the interviewers attention will be diverted as they look up the next question. With a digital interview guide we can easily record this interaction.

Other annotation types:

Body Language:

 * Buttons to tap when interviewee seems a certain way (e.g. nervous) or for gestures. (Used for themes/context).

Themes:

 * May be added after the interview ends.

Interview Design flow
-----------
Key informants -> focus groups -> pilot

The ability to add themes as the study progresses may be useful. Adding questions might cause methodological problems.
